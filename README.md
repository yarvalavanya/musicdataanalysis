# musicdataanalysis
This project is focused on analyzing a digital music store database to generate business insights using SQL. The dataset simulates a real-world music store with data on customers, invoices, tracks, genres, artists, and employees
For this project on Music Store Data Analysis, I started by first trying to understand the database schema. I learned how to explore the schema diagram and studied how various tables like Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Album, Genre, and Artist are connected. To get more comfortable, I even practiced by creating my own mini schema using tools like Schema.io. This hands-on approach really helped me visualize how the tables relate to each other and made it easier when I had to write queries later.

While solving the easy-level questions, I worked with basic SQL functions like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and SUM. For example, I found the senior-most employee by job title, identified countries with the most invoices, got the top 3 invoice totals, and figured out the city with the highest spending customers. These questions helped me get comfortable with aggregation and filtering.

As I moved to the moderate-level questions, I started using Common Table Expressions, or CTEs, to simplify my queries and keep the logic clean. One interesting task was listing all Rock music listeners and organizing them by email, which required joining multiple tables. Another challenge was identifying the top 10 rock artists by track count, which helped me practice grouping and counting across joins. I also had to compare individual song lengths with the average length using a CTE, which really taught me how powerful CTEs can be in making queries readable and efficient.

The advanced section was the most interesting because it brought everything together. For example, I had to find how much each customer spent on different artists — this involved multiple joins across several tables and required accurate grouping. Another complex task was finding the most popular music genre in each country based on purchases. I used a DENSE_RANK function in a CTE to handle cases where multiple genres had the same top purchase count.

Throughout the project, I not only improved my SQL writing but also learned how to think through data problems step-by-step. I got better at writing clean joins, using CTEs, analyzing schemas, and even designing them myself. By the end, I was confident in solving real-world SQL tasks and truly understood how to break down a project using SQL efficiently.
